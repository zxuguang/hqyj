      due to discontinuation of production triggered a panic pick-up rush on plush friends mania, is sweeping away among adults.</p>

      Is it strange? Disgraceful? Of course not!</p>

      The weather is cool, hold on to your favorite one, and let's explore the many threads between plush toys and humans.

      <h3>01 The proof of love:</h3>
      <p>Growing up, do you still love to sleep with stuffed toys?</p>

      <p>Google this question and you'll see many doctors who preach the benefits of doing so, and countless adults who do so telling their stories.</p>

      <p>In fact, the dependence of adults on these small stuffed things may be far more than you can imagine.</p>

      <p>Someone's bedside toy is still the favorite one (or several) as a child, has been very worn out or even sewn and mended many times; someone has to take it with them no matter where they go for business or travel, otherwise they will lose sleep all night ......</p>
      <p>So why do adults rely on stuffed toys? The first thing to understand is why children rely on stuffed toys.</p>

      <p>Psychologist Donald Winnicott refers to stuffed toys as "transition objects. Sleep is often the only independent time of the day when a child transitions from adult-dependent days to solitary nights, and a soft, warm stuffed animal can serve as a loyal and reliable companion, bringing a sense of security to the child.</p>

      <h3>02 The vulnerable side of adults </h3>
      <p> A soft, warm stuffed animal can serve as a loyal and reliable companion and bring a child a sense of security as he or she transitions from the adult-dependent day to the darkness of being alone.</p>
      Did you have a favorite stuffed animal as a child to which you would pour out your innermost secrets, dress it, bathe it, and even brush your teeth and feed it? In addition to silently guarding us, the more important identity of the stuffed animal, is with us inseparable good friend.</p>
      The vast majority of children's plush toys are usually still mass-produced assembly-line products. But even so, in the hearts of most people, their plush friends are still irreplaceable.</p>
      The love we have for them is actually no less than what they bring us.</p>

      <h3>03 If toys had life</h3>
      <p>Two years ago, the Shanghai Disney "plush actress", pink fox Ling Na Beier red all over the Internet.
      <p>Lina Belle belongs to Disney's "Duffy family". Unlike the animated characters, the Duffy family does not have any film or television work, only a simple background and persona support. And especially worth mentioning, is the first member of the family teddy bear Duffy story.</p>
      <p>Duffy, born in 2002, initially did not even have a name, just a teddy bear in the Disneyland store no one asked for. But Tokyo Disney saw a new business opportunity and gave it a unique backstory:</p>
      <p>Minnie hand-sewn a teddy bear toy for Mickey, who named it Duffy and wished he could walk with it. So the Fairy of Wonder really cast a magic spell, Duffy from then on has a life, and Mickey became a good friend.</p>
      <p>This story, not only makes Duffy become a super IP representative with Hello Kitty as well as no works but soaring popularity, providing Disney with a new "star-making model", but also speaks to the childhood wish that almost all children have had: "If only my toys could come to life! If only my toys could come to life!"</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Life is not "Toy Story", time may always give disappointing answers. So it seems that the desire to bring toys to life in reality can not be realized, but is a thankful thing.</li>

        <li>After all, growing up as an adult may make all the fantasies shattered, but the memory of the cute toys that will not grow up, but can always bring us any human can not replace the warmth and comfort.</li>
